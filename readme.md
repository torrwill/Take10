# Take10


*Take10 is a mobile app dedicated to helping people with anxiety. It includes deep breathing and grounding exercises as well as a list of resources for receiving counseling and gaining coping skills.*

# Installation and Usage
Clone git repo and run the application on your device or a mobile application emulator.

### Inspiration
Each individual member of this group has experience dealing with anxiety in their personal lives or with those around them. Knowing how this experience can affect a person, the objective of this project was to create a safe space where its users could momentarily escape the world around them and ground themselves in the here and now.

### What it does
Take10 is a mobile application designed for those who are looking for a way to unwind during or after an episode of elevated anxiety. The application features a breathing guide animation, where users can use a form of mindfulness breathing to bring their attention back to themselves and help them to reach a calmer state. Another feature is a grounding exercise, where the user will be walked through a step-by-step process of grounding themselves, should they feel themselves losing control. There is an additional resource component that contains additional coping skills and counseling near them as well as hotlines for panic and anxiety disorders.

### How we built it
This application was built using the React Native framework, which is a derivative of the React framework developed by Facebook. The application was developed in an iOS emulator environment in Visual Studio Code. Some portions of the code were developed concurrently with team members in a shared IDE environment and the entire project was completed collaboratively by 3 members.

### Challenges we ran into
This project was a challenge in many ways. The most significant hurdle faced during the development was that two members could not emulate the iOS environment on Windows, so only one person could run the emulator at any time. Additionally, 2 of the 5 members were unavailable during the entire development process. Images could not be imported without a major workaround, library imports were difficult to achieve due to incompatibilities with the code, and other technical challenges presented themselves.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
As challenging as developing this application was, the key takeaway was learning how to pair program, work collaboratively, use Github and learn a new framework or parts of the said framework in a short time frame.

### What we learned
We learned a whole lot of technologies, here are some points:

* We learned to develop a mobile app with React Native.
* We learned how to stay calm and focused.
* We learned to read the documentation and ask questions when stuck.
* Take risks, fail, learn, and move on faster.

## What's next for Take10
In the future, we want to make the application more interactive with input elements, to create an application that is more accessible for people with disabilities via text-to-speech and other technologies. In addition to this, we would like to implement colors that are colorblind-friendly as well as improve the animations, the design, and functionality of the application
